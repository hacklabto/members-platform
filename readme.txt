-- members-platform --

A very WIP new site platform for members.hacklab.to. Most things to be
implemented. Feel free to jump in and fix one of the `todo`s!

Built on:
- PostgreSQL, with sqlc and golang-migrate
- LDAP for authentication
- HTMX for web reactivity
- Tailwind CSS
- (in future) Charm Bracelet for TUIs
- A whole lot of the Go standard library :)
